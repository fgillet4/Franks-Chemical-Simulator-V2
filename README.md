### Steps to stage changes made and update repo

1. **If you want to add all new or modified files at once, use:**
   ```bash 
   git add .
   ``` 
2. **If you prefer to add specific files, use:**
   ```bash
   git add path/to/your/file
   ```
3. **For example:**
   ```bash
   git add src/renderer/index.html
   ```
4. **For example:**
   ```bash
   git add src/renderer/styles.css
   ```
### Steps to commit changes made
5. **Once you've staged your changes, commit them with a descriptive message:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Change made"
   ```
6. **After committing your changes, push them to your GitHub repository:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

7. **If it's the first time you're pushing or if you've recently re-initialized your Git repository, you might need to set the upstream for your local branch:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
